# AesPA-Net Requirements

# IMPORTANT: Install PyTorch + CUDA **FIRST** using Conda before running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
# Conda handles the complex GPU dependencies better than pip.
# Choose a PyTorch version compatible with your GPU drivers.
# Example Conda command for PyTorch 2.0.1 with CUDA 11.8 (compatible with many recent drivers):
# (Activate your conda environment first)
# conda install pytorch==2.0.1 torchvision==0.15.2 torchaudio==2.0.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# --- Do not uncomment the lines below ---
# torch
# torchvision
# torchaudio
# --- PyTorch should be installed via Conda as shown above ---

# Dependencies to be installed by pip AFTER PyTorch is installed via Conda:

# Unpinned versions - let pip find compatible versions for Python 3.10+ and PyTorch 2.x+
numpy
Pillow
imageio
scipy

# Other dependencies
matplotlib
scikit-video  # Note: May require separate ffmpeg installation depending on your OS
wandb
torchfile
opencv-python
